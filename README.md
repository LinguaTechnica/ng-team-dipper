# Our Team Page

This lesson is an introduction to the fundamental building block of Angular applications: components.

## Objectives:

You'll create a simple web page that displays information about your team. Goals:

* Create components
* Create component templates (HTML/CSS)
* Complete the application

## Getting Started

- Fork this repository
- Share your new fork with the team. One repo link per group!
- Clone your new repo on your local machine and navigate to it using the CLI.

Finally, run the application to make sure everything's working:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Angular CLI

Angular comes with it's own CLI tools that you can use to create new features in your application.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Code scaffolding

```bash
# create a new component in folder 'component-name'
ng generate component component-name
```
