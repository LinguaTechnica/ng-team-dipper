# Our Team Page

This lesson is an introduction to the fundamental building block of Angular applications: components.

## Objectives:

You'll create a simple web page that displays information about your team. Goals:

* Update a components' properties
* Update a component template (HTML/CSS)
* Use CSS to create graphics for the page

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
1. Share your new fork with the team. One repo link per group!
1. Clone your new repo on your local machine and navigate to it using the CLI.

Finally, run the application to make sure everything's working:
```
npm install
npm start
npm test
```

## Angular CLI

Angular comes with it's own CLI tools that you can use to create new features in your application.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
